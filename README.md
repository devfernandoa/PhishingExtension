# üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Detector ‚Äì Firefox Extension

This is a lightweight Firefox browser extension that detects phishing attempts by analyzing the current website URL using a remote phishing detection backend.

---

## Features

- Automatically checks every website you visit
- Sends the URL to a secure backend API for phishing analysis
- Displays:
  - Risk score (color-coded)
  - List of detected issues
  - Explanations of each potential threat
- Clean, dark-themed popup UI
- Uses your existing phishing detection backend (Express + TypeScript)

---

## How It Works

1. On any page load, `content.js` sends the current URL to `background.js`
2. `background.js` calls the backend API
3. The result is shown in the extension popup via `popup.html`
